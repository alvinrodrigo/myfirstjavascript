    <h2 id="demo2">Who am I?</h2>

    <p id="demo1">My full name is Alvin John J. Rodrigo but you can call me Alvin. Some will call me Aj but that is reserved for my family members only *wink. I am 18 y.o still livin' with my parents (bommer) but will move out (hopefully). As a student of Mary Immaculate Parish Special School (a highschool just half a kilometer away from my house), I am (almost) confidently say that I am (going to be) a better "MARIAN". It may seem impossible to be the "role model" of a school that promotes itself as a "Catholic Institution" which is not align with my personal beliefs. That's okay. More on that later. There are still a lot of "me" in this page. Don't mind me, I am just here to share about myself. You can go on with your life. It's fine! Don't waste your time here. Find something that makes your time worthwhile.</p>
